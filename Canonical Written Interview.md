# Canonical Written Interview

## Documentation experience and insight

In this section, we want you to show us what you can do. We want to understand what you think, how you think and how you earned your insights.

- > Outline your experience working on software documentation (think about: its type, audience, complexity, industry context, how you made a difference to it). Feel free to include a link to any publicly-visible work that you’d like to share with us.

  I have experience collaborating across teams to create detailed technical references, beginner friendly tutorials, instructional how-to guides, and in-depth explanations. I have helped lead the direction, planning, and implementation of company's documentation by utilizing the Diataxis framework and a docs-as-code workflow.

- > What is the most significant body of documentation that you have had responsibility for?

  I am always assigned the most technical topics. I have been responsible for documentating Liquid syntax with custom objects, API and webhook usage, and all aspects of domains and DNS (including email) at the same time.

- > What is your proudest success or accomplishment as a technical author?

  My proudest accomlishment is pivoting the direction and style of planned documentation to help streamline processes. This included implementing a docs-as-code workflow, templating, and training the team on how to use these new tools.

- > What open-source software documentation do you use the most? How would you suggest improving its content?

  - I have recently been referring to the GitLab administration documentation the most. One thing I noticed in some of the articles I was referencing is that some helpful notes are placed inside the examples instead of in the written instructions, which can lead to misunderstanding. I would add callouts for important notes and additional information in the instructions.

- > Consider one of the software documentation projects you have worked on. How well did its processes work, and what would you like to improve?

  - I worked on a project that used Google Doc files and manually maintained spreadsheets for most of their processes. This lead to a huge amount of overhead and incorrect formatting in the publishing software (the public help center). Eventually, I lead the migration to a docs-as-code workflow and utilized proper styling and automation across the board.

- > Describe a significant learning experience you had working on documentation - what happened, what did you learn and what did you change as a result?

  - While writing documentation for 

- > In general, what aspect of your documentation work do you find most challenging? Give an example or two to illustrate the nature of this challenge.

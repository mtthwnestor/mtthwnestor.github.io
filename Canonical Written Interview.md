# Canonical Written Interview

## Documentation experience and insight

In this section, we want you to show us what you can do. We want to understand what you think, how you think and how you earned your insights.

- > Outline your experience working on software documentation (think about: its type, audience, complexity, industry context, how you made a difference to it). Feel free to include a link to any publicly-visible work that you’d like to share with us.

  I have experience collaborating across teams to create detailed technical references, beginner friendly tutorials, instructional how-to guides, and in-depth explanations. I have helped lead the direction, planning, and implementation of company's documentation by utilizing the Diataxis framework and a docs-as-code workflow.

- > What is the most significant body of documentation that you have had responsibility for?

  I am always assigned the most technical topics. I have been responsible for documenting Liquid syntax with custom objects, API and webhook usage, and all aspects of domains and DNS (including email) at the same time.

- > What is your proudest success or accomplishment as a technical author?

  My proudest accomplishment is pivoting the direction and style of planned documentation to help streamline processes. This included implementing a docs-as-code workflow, templating, and training the team on how to use these new tools.

- > What open-source software documentation do you use the most? How would you suggest improving its content?

  I have recently been referring to the GitLab administration documentation the most. One thing I noticed in some of the articles I was referencing is that some helpful notes are placed inside the examples instead of in the written instructions, which can lead to misunderstanding. I would add callouts for important notes and additional information in the instructions.

- > Consider one of the software documentation projects you have worked on. How well did its processes work, and what would you like to improve?

  I worked on a project that used Google Doc files and manually maintained spreadsheets for most of their processes. This lead to a huge amount of overhead and incorrect formatting in the publishing software (the public help center). Eventually, I lead the migration to a docs-as-code workflow and utilized proper styling and automation across the board.

- > Describe a significant learning experience you had working on documentation - what happened, what did you learn and what did you change as a result?

  I am always learning something. At one point I had to learn how to utilize Adobe Premiere to edit and improve video content.

- > In general, what aspect of your documentation work do you find most challenging? Give an example or two to illustrate the nature of this challenge.

  In general, I have found reviewing other writers' articles to be the most challenging. The main reasons are due to my attention to detail and preference for certain consistencies and structure.

## Software experience

You don't need to be a software engineer to be a technical author, but you do need technical curiosity and to share the programmer's mindset. We want to understand what software means to you, and why you care about it.

- > Describe your programming skills and experience and what you have enjoyed. Tell us as much as you like, and feel free to include a link to any publicly-visible work that you’d like to share with us.

  I have mostly worked on creating custom solutions, such as automation or web pages. This includes anything from a trivia game to automated distributed publishing via third-party APIs. I love to find ways to improve processes or create completely new and improved ones.

- > Are there any areas of software technology (for example: operations, cloud services, infrastructure and application management and deployment; Linux operating systems, robotics, databases, or others) in which you have particular experience or interest?

  My experience is broad and includes pretty much everything listed in the question. I have a passion for running Linux and Docker to deploy and manage applications, infrastructure, and tools. I usually find my own methods to be simpler than most others.

- > What does open-source software mean to you personally?

  I started using open-source software at a very young age. It allowed me access to resources that I couldn't possibly obtain from any other proprietary software. Without open-source software, I would not have the same technical knowledge and skills that I have today.

- > Describe any experience you have working in open-source contexts, including development of software, documentation or community.

  I generally stick to reporting bugs and discussing issues. I would only attempt to contribute directly to the project if I fully understood the vision and believed I would contribute in a meaningful way.

- > Consider one of those contexts: did you observe any practices that you would like to improve?

  I have not found myself in a position where I was close enough with project maintainers to understand their views or practices.

## Leadership and professional engagement

A Canonical technical author is a participant, not a bystander. We want to know how you have made a difference to the professional practice of others.

- > Describe any speaking experience at events and conferences or other events, or public writing about documentation or software.

  I do not have speaking experience at events or conferences.

- > What influence have you had on others in the industry, through your speaking, writing or other work?

  Everyone I have worked closely with has mentioned that they learn a lot after working with me. I usually approach things a bit differently and am much more analytical, detailed, and structured.

- > Describe your engagement or participation in any professional or industry communities that focus on a relevant discipline (documentation, software, etc).

  I have not participated in professional or industry communities in a significant capacity.

## Education

It is Canonical hiring policy to consider a candidate's academic record, as evidence of excellence and ability. Any information or context that helps us understand your attainment is helpful. Please provide as much concrete detail - including grades, awards, final results and so on - as you can.

- > How did you rank amongst your peers in your final year of high school, in mathematics and the sciences? What was your strongest subject?

  My strongest subject was mathematics. I ranked among the highest in math and moth sciences.

- > How did you rank amongst your peers in your final year of high school, in languages and the arts? What was your strongest subject?

  Languages and arts in high school were not productive in pursuing the style of writing I enjoy. I did not rank among the highest in these subjects.

- > What were your results in your school-leaving and/or university entrance examinations (GPA, IB, matriculation, A-levels, SAT, ACT etc)?

  My GPA was average in high school.

- > What sort of high school student were you? Beyond your studies, what were your interests and hobbies? How do you think you are remembered by your peers?

  I was the quiet nerd that would be reading books or studying things that were not included in school, such as software and technology.

- > What degree and university did you choose, and why?

  I did not attend university and don't have a degree.

- > At university, did you do particularly well in any area of your degree?

  I did not attend university and don't have a degree.

- > Overall, what was your degree result and how did that reflect on your ability? (Note that different education traditions around the world use different scoring systems. Please give us additional context so that we understand what your degree result indicates, even if we're not familiar with that particular system.)

  I did not attend university and don't have a degree.

- > In high school and university, what did you achieve that was exceptional?

  In high school, I always achieved great results on tests. I did not attend university.

- > What leadership roles did you take on during your education?

  I participated in a program called Future Business Leaders of America where we would meet up and learn how to interact in professional environments.

## Canonical in context

In this section, we want to know how you see and understand Canonical and its mission.

- > Why do you want to be a technical author at Canonical?

  Like many others, Ubuntu was one of the first Linux distributions I started to use regularly as a kid. I was always aligned with the idea of streamlining user experience with open source software to make it more accessible and increase adoption.

- > Which Canonical products, or technology domains, are you most interested in working on?

  I am passionate operating systems, but am very interested in cloud products or any others.

- > What is your understanding of Canonical’s position in the open-source software market? What strengths and weaknesses do you see?

  Canonical is a very important high profile name in the open-source market. It has an obligation to ensure that it meets the needs of its users. I have noticed more products being offered but have not had easy access to them. When I think of Canonical I want to have easy access to products that just work.s
